## Acknowledgements

This web server was initially based on Dave O'Hallaron's Tiny Web server,
created at Carnegie Mellon University. It also uses the same csapp library of
functions as Tiny.

The specification for this web server is also provided by Professor O'Hallaron,
through the "Internet Services" course at CMU (18-845).
